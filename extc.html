        The Electronics & Communication Engineering involves the transmission of information across channels such as a coax cable, optical fiber or free space. You can work on designing equipment such as routers, switches, multiplexers and electronic switching systems, copper telephone facilities and fiber optics.</p><br>
            
        <strong>What is Electronics & Communication Engineering?</strong>

 

<p>This branch of engineering develops everyday devices such as transistors, integrated circuits and printed circuit boards (PCBs) which can be used in computers, MP3 players, cell phones, television to name a few.<br>

 

The discipline deals with electronic devices and software interfaces. The applications are far reaching, right from the indoors of the house to industries. The tasks of the Electronics and Communication engineers are to direct, control and test produce processes a well as to ensure safety, installation and functioning of the various mechanisms.<br>

 

    The discipline integrates knowledge based on digital electronics and logic design, fundamentals of communication engineering, electronic circuits, signals and systems, power electronics, applied electromagnetic theory, integrated circuits, VLSI, control systems and computer architecture.</p><br> <hr>
