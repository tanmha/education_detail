            <strong>WHAT IS MECHANICAL ENGINEERING ?</strong><br><br>
<p>Mechanical engineering is a professional programme which helps students to understand the working mechanisms of heavy tools and machineries.  The branch applies principles of engineering, physics and material science for the design, analysis, manufacturing and maintenance of mechanical systems. The course covers technical areas like distribution of electricity through generators, transformers, transmission lines, lighting and wiring in buildings. A course in mechanical engineering makes a student gain knowledge and experience in the designing of electric motors, automobiles, aircrafts and other heavy vehicles. Mechanical engineering demands knowledge about software used in technical work like computer-aided design and mathematical modelling.

            <strong>SCOPE OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING</strong>
            <ul>
<li>Mechanical Engineering covers aspects like design and testing among others. The job demands supervision and planning of live projects related to thermal power plants, nuclear stations, generation of electricity, etc.<br></li>
<li>There are employment opportunities for diploma holders who have practical knowledge of working on fields like testing of machinery etc.</li><br>
<li>The emerging fields in this area include renewable energy, automobiles, quality control, Industrial Automation, Mechanobiology. These are going to increase manpower in the work profile of mechanical engineering and would offer employment opportunities.<br></li>  
            </ul><hr>

            <strong>Duties of Mechanical Engineers</strong><br><br>
            <p>Mechanical engineers typically do the following:</p>
            <ol>

                <li>Analyze problems to see how mechanical and thermal devices might help solve a particular problem</li><br>
                <li>Design or redesign mechanical and thermal devices or subsystems, using analysis and computer-aided design</li><br>
<li>Investigate equipment failures or difficulties to diagnose faulty operation and to recommend remedies</li><br>
<li>Develop and test prototypes of devices they design</li><br>
<li>Analyze the test results and change the design or system as needed</li><br>
<li>Oversee the manufacturing process for the device</li><br>
            </ol><hr>
            
            
            <strong>Important Qualities for Mechanical Engineers</strong><br>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Creativity. Mechanical engineers design and build complex pieces of equipment and machinery. A creative mind is essential for this kind of work.</li>

                <li>Listening skills. Mechanical engineers often work on projects with others, such as architects and computer scientists. They must listen to and analyze different approaches made by other experts to complete the task at hand.</li>

                <li>Math skills. Mechanical engineers use the principles of calculus, statistics, and other advanced subjects in math for analysis, design, and troubleshooting in their work.</li>

                <li>Mechanical skills. Mechanical skills allow engineers to apply basic engineering concepts and mechanical processes to the design of new devices and systems.</li>

                <li>Problem-solving skills. Mechanical engineers need good problem-solving skills to take scientific principles and discoveries and use them to design and build useful products.</li>
