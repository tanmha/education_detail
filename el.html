        <strong>WHAT IS ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING ?</strong><br><br>
        <p>Electrical engineering, one of the core courses of engineering discipline deals with the study of design, development, and maintenance of electrical systems and their components, ensuring quality, safety, reliability, and sustainability. The course focuses on the manufacturing of electrical equipment used in a number of sectors including construction and building and the production and distribution of power. Students pursuing electrical engineering study about semiconductors and microprocessors. The undergraduate course will award a B.Tech / B.E. degree and the postgraduate course, an M.Tech.</p><br><hr>
        
        
        <strong>A Day in the Life of an Electrical Engineer</strong><br><br>
<p>Electronic engineers perform their duties in offices and laboratories but may also be sent to work sites for supervising and troubleshooting. This is especially true for those who work in companies that manufacture complex equipment. They spend about 40 hours per week at work, but they may work longer than this.

    A typical day for an electrical engineer varies depending on their employer. Those who work for the federal government may handle responsibilities in areas of research, development and electronic device evaluation that may cover systems for manufacturing, transportation, aviation and communication. Electrical engineers use design software and equipment in their projects.</p><br><hr>
        
        <strong>Important Qualities for Electrical and Electronics Engineers</strong><br>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Concentration. Electrical and electronics engineers design and develop complex electrical systems and electronic components and products. They must keep track of multiple design elements and technical characteristics when performing these tasks.</li><br>

<li>Initiative. Electrical and electronics engineers must apply their knowledge to new tasks in every project they undertake. In addition, they must engage in continuing education to keep up with changes in technology.</li><br>

<li>Interpersonal skills. Electrical and electronics engineers must work with others during the manufacturing process to ensure that their plans are implemented correctly. This collaboration includes monitoring technicians and devising remedies to problems as they arise.</li><br>

<li>Math skills. Electrical and electronics engineers must use the principles of calculus and other advanced math in order to analyze, design, and troubleshoot equipment.</li><br>

<li>Speaking skills. Electrical and electronics engineers work closely with other engineers and technicians. They must be able to explain their designs and reasoning clearly and to relay instructions during product development and production. They also may need to explain complex issues to customers who have little or no technical expertise.</li><br>

<li>Writing skills. Electrical and electronics engineers develop technical publications related to equipment they develop, including maintenance manuals, operation manuals, parts lists </li><br>
        </ol>
