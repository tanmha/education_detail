            <p class="c1"><strong>What is Engineering?</strong></p>
            <p>Engineering is the application of science and math to solve problems. Engineers figure out how things work and find practical uses for scientific discoveries. Scientists and inventors often get the credit for innovations that advance the human condition, but it is engineers who are instrumental in making those innovations available to the world.</p>
        <p>In his book, "Disturbing the Universe" (Sloan Foundation, 1981), physicist Freeman Dyson wrote, <i><b>"A good scientist is a person with original ideas. A good engineer is a person who makes a design that works with as few original ideas as possible. There are no prima donnas in engineering."</b></i></p>
        <p>As the novelist James A. Michener aptly put it in his novel "Space" (Fawcett, 1983),<b><i> "Scientists dream about doing great things. Engineers do them."</i></b></p><br><br>
            <p class="c1"><strong>What does an engineer do?</strong></p>
        <p>Engineers design, evaluate, develop, test, modify, install, inspect and maintain a wide variety of products and systems. They also recommend and specify materials and processes, supervise manufacturing and construction, conduct failure analysis, provide consulting services and teach engineering courses in colleges and universities.</p><br><br>
            <p class="c1"><strong>Engineer's job and salary</strong></p>
        <p>Many employers require engineers to obtain state certification as Professional Engineers.The Indian Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has information on various specialized fields of engineering, including educational requirements, job descriptions, work environments and job outlooks.</p>
        <p>Employment of engineers is projected to grow from 4 to 27 percent between now and 2022, depending on the field of specialization, according to the BLS.</p>
        <p>The average salary of a newly graduated engineer, if he gets a job, can be Rs. 3,37,899 per annum.</p><br><br>
