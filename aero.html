        <strong>WHAT IS AEROSPACE ENGINEERING ?</strong><br><br>
        <p>Aerospace is a specialised branch of engineering which deals with the design and development of aircraft's as well as space crafts The course curriculum covers aspects of two branches of engineering - aeronautical and astronautical engineering. The course also focuses on new technologies in aviation, defence systems, and space exploration. The course is offered at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels awarding B.Tech and M.Tech degrees.</p><br>

        <strong>SCOPE OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING</strong><br><br>
<p>When the world is designing more cost-effective satellites and space shuttles, itâ€™ll need expert brains to design such machines.<br>
As the world is moving towards commercialisation of space shuttles and rockets, the demand for aerospace engineers is set to increase.<br>
    With a number of private players entering into aerospace technology, the opportunities are getting better.</p><br><hr>

        <strong>Duties of Aerospace Engineers</strong><br><br>
        <p>Aerospace engineers typically do the following:</p>
<ol>
    
    <li>Direct and coordinate the design, manufacture, and testing of aircraft and aerospace products</li>
<li>Assess proposals for projects to determine if they are technically and financially feasible</li>
<li>Determine if proposed projects will result in safe operations that meet the defined goals</li>
<li>Evaluate designs to see that the products meet engineering principles, customer requirements, and environmental regulations</li>
<li>Develop acceptance criteria for design methods, quality standards, sustainment after delivery, and completion dates</li>
<li>Ensure that projects meet quality standards</li>
<li>Inspect malfunctioning or damaged products to identify sources of problems and possible solutions</li>
        </ol>
